1. I pass in the array that i want to sort and the function takes in 3 arguments
arr: the array to be sorted
start:the index of the  first element in the array which is 0 by default 
end: which is the last element of the array which is by default equal to the length of the array-1

2. Inside the quicksort function theres a function Partiton that helps divide the function into 2 parts the i.e elements less than the array on the left and element s greater than the pivot on the right

note: the pivot element can be any random variable in the list but i chose the pivot to be the same as the last elemnt in the list

3. the partition function takes three parameters (arr,start,end) same as the quicksort parameters
